        since new_outputs_fee retains some coins.
    R - is summ of private keys and private keys of additional excsses. For know excsses are append-only to blockchain, thus R*H is summ of all addresses's pubkeys and all additional excsses. Note, while R is not known, R*H can be calculated from public data.
    This function check that calculated
